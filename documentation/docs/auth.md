# Authentication

Authentication is required to use the News Api.

Registration is required to authenticate.

When you log in, the API will give you an authentication key that must accompany each API call you make.

The authentication key used is a Json Web Token and lasts 30 minutes.

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

All details concerning registering and logging in are available on the next page.
